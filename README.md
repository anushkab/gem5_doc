To get a better view (svg images), go to [Entry](http://lzyerste.github.io/gem5_doc/gem5).

It is a public repository used for analyzing gem5 source code.

Little by little, I am getting closer to the core of gem5. Personally, I am interested in the memory system, including processor cache and main memory (NVM).

Some useful tools during analyzing:

* **sublime text 3**: to navigate code
* **drawio**: to draw flowcharts, which is much more lightweight than Microsoft Visio
* **typora**: to write markdown documents
  * **markdown**: [quick reference from typora](http://support.typora.io/Markdown-Reference/)
  * **mermaid**: to depict simple flowcharts. [tutorial](https://knsv.github.io/mermaid/)
