========

To get a better view (svg images), go to [Entry](http://lzyerste.github.io/gem5_doc).

It is a public repository used for analyzing gem5 source code.

Little by little, I am getting closer to the core of gem5.

Some useful tools during analyzing:

* **sublime text 3**: to navigate code
* **drawio**: to draw flowcharts
* **typora**: to write markdown documents
