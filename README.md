[Entry](./gem5/index.md)

It is a public repository used for analyzing gem5 source code.

Little by little, I am getting closer to the core of gem5.

Some useful tools during analyzing:

* **sublime text 3**: to navigate code
* **drawio**: to draw flowcharts
* **typora**: to write markdown documents
